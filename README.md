# Wikilists
A tool for working with the wikipedia reading list api. Documentation of which you can find here: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ReadingLists#API.
The wikimedia reading list API is internal and thus may change without notice.
That being said, at the time of writing it has not changed since 2017.

This uses the `requests` module which can be installed with pip: `pip install requests`

`demo.py` demonstrates how to work with reading lists.
